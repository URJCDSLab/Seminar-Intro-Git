# Seminar-Intro-Git
Materials for the teaching innovation seminar "Introduction to Git" in the DSLAB-TI series

## Requirements

- [Install Git in your machine](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html).
  + Optionally, you can do some [basic Git configuration](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)
  before you start these tutorials.
- [Install/update R and RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html).
- [Register your GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html), in case you haven't
already.
  + **IMPORTANT**: You will also need a Personal Access Token (PAT) if you want to
  upload your local commits to a remote repository (e.g. on GitHub). In that case,
  you must [create a PAT](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#get-a-pat) before
  you start practicing.

## Practical tutorial

1. We create [a new GitHub project and clone it locally](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html).
2. We test our new repository [editing a simple R Markdown / Quarto project](https://happygitwithr.com/rmd-test-drive.html). We track changes in
our local machine and also send them to the remote GitHub repository.
